CALM (Covid-19 and Life Management)
==================
## What is it?
Provides mental health surveys, check-ins, and advice in order to spread awareness and help people struggling with mental health issues during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Also, it contains a 'Share Your Story' feature, which allows users to connect with others facing similar struggles.

## Why this project is useful
- Promotes empathy, awareness, and allows user to learn new perspectives
- Provides connection during this time of social isolation
- Allows user to get in touch with their feelings and emotions
- Personalized design/user experience
- Tackles the root causes mental health issues during the pandemic (ex. greif, isolation, etc.)
- 
## How I built this 
- Coded in the compiler/software Qoom
- Written with Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
- First time trying a Hackathon all by myself
- This was my first time trying CSS to create a graphic user interface and my second time using Javascript and HTML. So, I am proud that I pushed myself/went out of my comfort zone to learn these new skills and create a new idea. 
- I am also happy that the project I created contained a large breadth of functions.

## What is next for this project
- Maybe designing a logo
- Add elements with PHP
- Clean up the 'Share Your Story' tab (it was my first time creating something like that)
- Have users create chat-rooms to talk directly
